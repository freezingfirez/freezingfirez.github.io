  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: July 25, 2025</p>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to all mobile applications developed by <strong>Nathan Fischer</strong>, including but not limited to <em>Simply Click</em> and <em>GlobalTag</em>.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information unless explicitly stated within the app. Some apps may request permission to access your device’s location (e.g., GlobalTag) to enable core features. This data is stored locally and not shared with us or any third party.</p>

  <h2>2. Location Data</h2>
  <p>Some apps, such as GlobalTag, use your device’s location to provide key features like tagging and proximity notifications. Your location is never sent to a server or shared externally. It is only used within the app and stored on your device.</p>

  <h2>3. Photos and Media</h2>
  <p>Apps may allow attaching photos or accessing your gallery (e.g., when tagging locations). These photos remain on your device and are never uploaded or shared unless explicitly stated.</p>

  <h2>4. Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not use third-party analytics tools or trackers in our apps at this time. If that changes in the future, this policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

  <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>Some apps offer in-app purchases (e.g., unlocking Premium features). These transactions are securely handled by Apple’s App Store. We do not receive your payment details.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Data</h2>
  <p>All user data is stored locally on your device unless otherwise specified. You can delete the app to remove all stored data. No accounts or cloud storage is currently used.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy may be updated occasionally. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this policy or any app, please contact us at <a href="mailto:nathan@fischdesigns.com">nathan@fischdesigns.com</a>.</p>
